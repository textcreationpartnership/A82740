         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He People of <hi>England</hi> having been neceſsitated to take up Arms in the juſt defence of their Lawes and Liberties againſt the late King: And it having pleaſed GOD, after a long War, and many Battels fought in the Field, ſo to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135136:4"/>
bleſſe their Armies, and to bring the VVar to ſuch an iſſue, that if they were not wanting to themſelves, they might reap the fruit of all the Bloud and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure exhauſted in that Quarrel, and not only be reſtored to their Freedom for the preſent, but ſecured againſt all the like attempts for the future. The Parliament hereupon, as the <hi>Truſtees</hi> of the People, for the accompliſhing of thoſe ends, did declare and enact, That the People of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging, ſhould be thenceforth governed as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and Free State, by the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the People in Parliament, and that without any King, or Houſe of Lords; Judging: this not only to be the undoubted Right of the People, but that the Office of a King in theſe Nations, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135136:4"/>
to have the Power thereof in any Single Perſon, as alſo the Houſe of Lords, was burdenſom and dangerous to the Safety and Liberty of the People: And by this meanes the Foundations of a Publique Intereſt being layed in the place of that which was only private and perſonal, this People might grow up (through the goodneſs of God) into perfect Freedom, being Governed in the Supreme Power by their own Repreſentatives; and in the Executive Power, by their known Laws and Judicatory; the beſt Meaſure and Standard of Liberty: their Navigation and Trade encouraged and promoted, which in all Monarchies is ſtinted and reſtrained. The true Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both at home and abroad owned and countenanced, which under the former Conſtitution was clogged with vain and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135136:5"/>
ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, and corrupt opinions touching Faith and Worſhip, impoſed upon all, without any regard had to tender Conſciences, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, and the Profeſſors thereof, with Godlineſs it ſelf, diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and perſecuted.</p>
            <p>To this ſtate of things did the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment judge it their Duty to bring this Nation, and the Free People therof; and no man can reaſonably doubt, but that long before this time, the Parliament (through the ſame good and gracious preſence that had accompanied their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings) would have accompliſhed their Intentions in theſe things, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Commonwealth upon the Baſis and Foundation aforeſaid, if they had not been ſo often Interrupted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prevented hitherto from doing that,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135136:5"/>
which alwayes was and is the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and intention of their hearts.</p>
            <p>And yet the Parliament cannot but take notice of the Artifices that are uſed to miſ-repreſent their Intentions, and to blemiſh their Proceedings before the People, unjuſtly charging them with a Deſign to perpetuate themſelves now Sitting, to ſubject the People to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, and to govern them by Force. And as to matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on one hand, That they are enemies to the Miniſtry, their Maintenance by Tythes, to the Univerſities and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and encouragers of Fanatick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; On the other hand, That the Parliament is too ſevere, and of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Principles in matters of Religion; not being ignorant, that thoſe who by theſe means do induſtriouſly labour to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135136:6"/>
diſ-affect the People to the Parliament, are ſuch, who by ſpecious pretences would firſt put out their eyes, that they might not ſee the way to their own true Liberty, and then bring them back again into their old Servitude.</p>
            <p>The Parliament therefore, to omit nothing in their power that may unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honeſt and well meaning men, have thought it neceſſary in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Time and Affairs, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and Manifeſt (as they do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) what their Intentions are, as to the Government of theſe Nations, with ſome other particulars relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; wherein they are Reſolved (through the Goodneſſe and Aſsiſtance of God) to remain conſtant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>

               <p n="3">
